# Design concept brief

You are proposing one visual direction for the product below. Answer in text only; write
no code and no files.

Plan with the three skills frontend-design, design-craft and design-references (invoke all
three with the Skill tool and follow them), including frontend-design's review of the plan
against its default looks (revise any part that reads like a default and say what you
changed). Also check the palette against design-craft's fallback palettes.

Your reference: `revolut.md` (read it at /Users/mslee/.claude-seat/skills/design-references/references/revolut.md). Take its screen composition, not its colours,
logo, name or signature shapes, and never name the brand.

Your surface: **dark**.

## The product

Pocketful is a consumer wallet in a browser: people send money to each other by handle
(`^[a-z0-9_]{1,20}$`, e.g. `ada`), request money, split bills into equal shares, and reserve
money for a recipient to collect later (an authorisation that places a hold; the recipient
captures it in one or more captures; the payer can void it; it expires on its own).
Payments are `public` (visible in everyone's feed) or `private` (only the two parties).
Requests are `pending`, then `paid`, `declined` or `cancelled`. Authorisations are `open`,
`captured`, `voided` or `expired`. Amounts are formatted like `100.00 EUR` or `1200 JPY`.

## Requirement text (verbatim)

# Pocketful — Stage 2: wallet screens and payment authorizations

The stage-1 requirements continue to apply, with the additions below. Numbered section
references such as §5 and §7 refer to `stage-1.md`.

Users can manage payments, requests and bill splits in a browser. They can also reserve
money for a recipient to collect later, in one or more captures.

The following screens must be reachable by URL. Other screens must be reachable through
the UI. Server-side and client-side rendering are both permitted.

| Route | Screen |
|---|---|
| `/` | Balance, pay form, request form and the activity feed |
| `/requests` | Incoming and outgoing requests, with pay, decline and cancel |
| `/split` | Split form |
| `/signup` | Signup |
| `/login` | Login |

The browser and the API share `/requests`. Return the UI for `Accept: text/html`; API requests
without that header receive JSON.

The UI must expose the `data-testid` attributes listed below for integration testing.
Additional elements are permitted, and the visual implementation is the team's choice subject
to the product-quality requirements below.

## Product and visual direction

The browser experience must feel like a coherent, presentation-ready consumer finance product,
not a test harness with controls attached. Aim for a calm, trustworthy character. Available funds
must be the clearest monetary value once holds exist, with total and held funds visibly secondary.
Payments, requests, splits and authorisations should be easy to scan, and status, direction,
privacy and money movement should be understandable without interpreting raw API data.

Use a consistent visual system for typography, spacing, colour, controls and feedback. Primary
actions must be easy to identify. Available, held, pending, loading, successful, refused and
uncertain states must be visually distinct as well as satisfying the behavioural requirements
below. Format people, amounts and timestamps for people first; expose technical identifiers only
where they help the user.

The required flows must remain clear and usable at a 375 CSS-pixel viewport and at conventional
desktop widths, without horizontal page scrolling. Inputs need visible labels, keyboard focus must
be apparent, and text and controls need sufficient contrast. Provide considered empty, loading and
error states, and keep navigation consistent across the required routes. A custom illustration,
brand asset or exact visual match to a reference is not required.

## Signup and login

| `data-testid` | Element |
|---|---|
| `signup-email`, `signup-password`, `signup-display-name` | Inputs |
| `signup-submit` | Button |
| `login-email`, `login-password`, `login-submit` | Inputs and button |
| `auth-error` | Error message. Present only when there is one |
| `current-user` | Visible on every screen when signed in. Text contains the display name |
| `current-handle` | Text is exactly the caller's handle, with no `@` and no surrounding words |
| `logout-button` | Button |

## Balance and pay — `/`

| `data-testid` | Element |
|---|---|
| `wallet-balance` | Text is exactly the formatted amount. Carries `data-amount="{minor units}"` |
| `pay-handle`, `pay-amount`, `pay-note` | Inputs. `pay-amount` is a **decimal** string as a person would type it, e.g. `15.00` |
| `pay-visibility` | Selects `public` or `private`. Option values are those two strings |
| `pay-submit` | Button |
| `pay-error` | Error message, when the payment is refused — including insufficient funds |
| `request-handle`, `request-amount`, `request-note`, `request-submit` | The request form |
| `request-error` | Error message, when the request is refused |

Keep the pay form's values after success. Submitting it again without changing a field
must not send another payment: `wallet-balance` falls once, the feed contains one payment
and `pay-error` is absent. Changing a field makes the next submission a new payment request.
Retries follow §7.

**Formatted amount.** `wallet-balance` is the decimal with exactly `minor_units` decimal places, a
single space, then the currency code: `100.00 EUR`. For a `minor_units` of `0` there is no decimal
point at all: `1200 JPY`. Balances are never negative, so there is no sign.

The form accepts decimal amounts and submits minor units to the API. With `minor_units: 2`,
`15.00` and `15` both submit `1500`; `15.5` submits `1550`. Nonnumeric input or more than
`minor_units` decimal places must show the form's error element without sending a request.
For example, `15.005` is rejected rather than rounded.

## Activity feed — `/`

| `data-testid` | Element |
|---|---|
| `activity-list` | Container. Its children are newest first in the DOM |
| `activity-item-{payment_id}` | One per visible payment. Carries `data-visibility="public"` or `data-visibility="private"` |
| `activity-parties-{payment_id}` | Text contains both handles |
| `activity-amount-{payment_id}` | Text is exactly the formatted amount |
| `activity-note-{payment_id}` | Text is exactly the note. Present even when the note is empty |
| `empty-activity` | Shown instead of the list when nothing is visible |

Two payments with equal timestamps may appear in either order.

## Requests — `/requests`

| `data-testid` | Element |
|---|---|
| `incoming-list`, `outgoing-list` | Containers |
| `request-item-{request_id}` | One per request. Carries `data-status="{status}"` |
| `request-amount-{request_id}` | Text is exactly the formatted amount |
| `request-pay-{request_id}` | Button. Present only on a `pending` incoming request |
| `request-decline-{request_id}` | Button. Present only on a `pending` incoming request |
| `request-cancel-{request_id}` | Button. Present only on a `pending` outgoing request |
| `request-error` | Shown when a pay, decline or cancel is refused |
| `empty-requests` | Shown when both lists are empty |

## Split — `/split`

| `data-testid` | Element |
|---|---|
| `split-amount` | Decimal input, same rule as `pay-amount` |
| `split-handles` | Text input: handles separated by commas, in order |
| `split-note`, `split-submit` | Input and button |
| `split-preview` | Shows the computed shares before submitting. Contains one `split-share-{handle}` per participant |
| `split-share-{handle}` | Text is exactly the formatted share amount |
| `split-error` | Error message, when the split is refused |

`split-preview` must show the shares the server would compute, by the rule in `stage-1.md`
§9, before anything is posted. The preview and submitted split must have identical shares.

After any successful action, the balance, the feed and the request lists on the same page must
show the new state without a manual reload. Navigation must wait for the write to succeed before
it refreshes the data. Any mechanism is fine, including a full navigation. **There is no
live-update requirement here** — another client may change state, but this browser need only
refresh after its own action or an explicit refresh.


## Competing clients and uncertain outcomes

- Add `wallet-refresh`, a button on `/` that refreshes the balance and feed without clearing
  the pay form. **Latest refresh wins:** a delayed earlier read must not overwrite a later
  refresh, including when responses arrive out of order.
- Another client may spend the balance after this browser reads it. A refused payment shows
  `pay-error`, refreshes the balance/feed, and preserves all pay inputs. A request cancelled
  elsewhere while its pay button is visible must show `request-error` when payment is refused
  and refresh the request list so the stale pay button disappears.
- If a payment response is lost, including after `POST /payments` commits, show `pay-uncertain`
  (nonempty text), not `pay-error`. Keep the unchanged form retryable with the **same key and
  body**. Successful retry removes both error/uncertainty elements, refreshes the balance and
  feed, and moves money exactly once. Unknown outcomes are not confirmed rejections.

No background polling, live synchronization, or recovery across page reloads is required.
The same balance refresh rules apply to the available and held amounts introduced below.


## UI

A new route `/authorizations`, and the wallet gains two numbers. The UI and the API share
`/authorizations`: serve HTML for `Accept: text/html` and JSON otherwise, as for `/requests`.

| `data-testid` | Element |
|---|---|
| `wallet-balance` | Formatted `total`, retaining the existing display and `data-amount` |
| `wallet-available` | Formatted `available`, with `data-amount`. **Present this as the headline number** — it is what the user can actually spend |
| `wallet-held` | Formatted `held`, with `data-amount`. Absent when `held` is zero |
| `authorize-handle`, `authorize-amount`, `authorize-note`, `authorize-visibility`, `authorize-submit` | The authorise form. Same input rules as the pay form |
| `authorize-error` | Shown when the authorisation is refused, including insufficient available funds |
| `authorization-list` | Container on `/authorizations`. Children newest first in the DOM |
| `authorization-item-{authorization_id}` | Carries `data-status="{status}"` |
| `authorization-amount-{id}` | Text is exactly the formatted authorised amount |
| `authorization-captured-{id}` | Formatted captured amount. Present only when `status` is `captured` |
| `authorization-expires-{id}` | Text is the RFC 3339 `expires_at` |
| `authorization-capture-amount-{id}` | Decimal input, pre-filled with the remaining amount. Present only on an incoming `open` authorisation |
| `authorization-capture-{id}` | Button. Present only on an incoming `open` authorisation |
| `authorization-void-{id}` | Button. Present only on an outgoing `open` authorisation |
| `authorization-error` | Shown when a capture or a void is refused |
| `empty-authorizations` | Shown when the list is empty |

The UI must reflect seeded and newly created holds. Show available funds as the user's
spending balance, including immediately after reset with open holds.


## Screens and states named by the requirements

Screens: `/signup`, `/login` (the front door), `/` (balance with available as headline,
total and held secondary; pay form; request form; authorise form; activity feed;
refresh button), `/requests` (incoming and outgoing lists with pay/decline/cancel),
`/split` (split form with live share preview), `/authorizations` (list with capture amount
input and capture button on incoming open, void on outgoing open).
States that must look different: available, held, pending, loading, successful, refused,
uncertain (payment response lost — retryable), plus empty states (activity, requests,
authorisations), form errors (auth, pay, request, authorise, split, request action,
authorisation action), request statuses, authorisation statuses, public vs private.

## Product constraints

- The product may have no network at runtime: font files, icons and every other asset live
  inside it.
- Every element and text the requirements name stays visible, in place and exactly as
  specified. Nothing the design adds, motion included, delays, hides or moves it.
- The screens meet the requirements' rules for viewports, labels, keyboard focus and contrast.

## Answer with

1. The plan: palette (4–6 named hex values, with contrast ratios for text/background pairs),
   typefaces and roles (fonts must be bundleable, open licence), type scale, spacing scale,
   layout (ASCII wireframes of `/` at 375 px and desktop), and principles.
2. What you took from your reference, and what you changed in your review against defaults.
3. The plan shown on: the main figure (the available balance with total and held), a list
   row (an activity item, a request row and an authorisation row), a status marker (request
   and authorisation statuses, public/private), an empty state, an error (refused and the
   uncertain state), and the front door (/signup and /login), each with exact words.
4. One delight moment: what a person should feel and why, the smallest interaction that
   delivers it, and its reduced-motion behaviour.
